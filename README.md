# CO2_Emissions_Project_Omdena
Here I will upload some of my work of the real world CO2_emissions_Predicting project hosted by Omdena. The project was divided into 4 main groups: Data, modelling, Deployment and research, where I was one of the co-leaders of the Modelling team/task and actively contributed to the Deployment of the project as well as the research (paper). 

I want to mention that everything I upload here are my own contributions to the project, here you can find a link to the general repository of the project: https://github.com/OmdenaAI/saudi-arabia-industrial-co2

In this project we made different kind of regression models in order to visualize the feature importance, contributions of features and the (linear)  correlations between these to our target feature, which is the total amount of CO2 emissions. 

We also made different kind of Time-Series models in order to forecast future values in a univariate as well as a multivariate way. Some of my made models include: a Transformer model (univariate & multivariate), a DeepTCN model, a NeuralProphet model and more!  

As you can see there are also notebooks with baseline models which helped us to get the project started. 

All of my models are made on a dataset which I "feature engineered" myself and this file is also located here in the repository. I've experimented with this regular yearly dataset as well as I used the linear interpolation technique to turn this dataset into a monthly frequenty.
