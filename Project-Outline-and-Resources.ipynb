    "# Project outline: AI-based Prediction of CO2 Emissions for a Healthier Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "Climate change and environmental degradation caused by increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are critical challenges facing our world today. To combat this pressing issue, there is an urgent need to develop accurate and effective methods to predict CO2 emissions. This project aims to leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) to create a robust prediction model that can forecast CO2 emissions from various sources, enabling better decision-making and informed policies to achieve a more sustainable and healthier environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Statement:**\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to build an AI-powered prediction system that accurately forecasts CO2 emissions from different sectors and activities. The system will be designed to take historical data on emissions and relevant features into account, using advanced AI techniques to model and predict future emissions levels. The key components and requirements of this project include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Collection and Preprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Gather comprehensive datasets from various reputable sources, containing historical CO2 emissions data from industries, transportation, energy production, agriculture, and other relevant sectors.\n",
    "Perform data preprocessing to clean, normalize, and handle missing values, ensuring the quality and reliability of the input data for the AI model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature Engineering:\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify and select pertinent features that significantly influence CO2 emissions, such as economic indicators, population growth, energy consumption, technological advancements, and environmental policies.\n",
    "Develop methodologies to extract and engineer relevant features from the available data to improve the model's predictive accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- AI Model Development:\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we will establish a baseline model in order to have a starting point we can work from. It may also be handy to already think about which kind of metric(s) we want to use in order to test our models accuracy and think about which metric would best suit our project. \n",
    "\n",
    "After building our baseline model and deciding which evaluation metric would suit best this project. We can start to explore and compare different AI techniques, including machine learning algorithms (e.g., regression, random forests, gradient boosting), neural networks (e.g., LSTM, CNN), and time series forecasting methods to determine the most suitable approach for predicting the CO2 emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our next step would be to implement and fine-tune our selected AI models and run these models in parallel to achieve optimal performance in terms of accuracy, robustness, and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model Training and Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Divide the dataset into training and validation sets, employing appropriate cross-validation techniques to ensure the model's generalization capability.\n",
    "Evaluate the model's performance using relevant metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error, ...) to quantify its accuracy in predicting CO2 emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Real-time Prediction and Visualization (Deploying our model to the cloud):\n",
    "\n",
    "Develop an interactive platform to visualize the real-time CO2 emission predictions, allowing users to access and analyze the results in a user-friendly manner.\n",
    "Provide insights and interpretability features to understand the significant factors influencing emissions and identify potential areas for emission reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Impact:**\n",
    "\n",
    "By successfully developing an AI-based CO2 emissions prediction system, this project will contribute to a more sustainable and healthier environment in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Empowering policymakers: Accurate emission predictions will assist policymakers in formulating data-driven strategies and policies to effectively mitigate climate change and reduce emissions in different sectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Promoting sustainable practices: Industries and businesses can leverage the predictions to make informed decisions, optimize resource usage, and adopt greener technologies to minimize their carbon footprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Raising public awareness: The visualization platform will enhance public understanding of the impact of various activities on CO2 emissions, encouraging individual behavioral changes and environmentally conscious actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This ambitious project aims to harness the power of AI to predict CO2 emissions accurately. By combining comprehensive datasets, advanced AI techniques, and real-time visualization, we seek to create a valuable tool that can play a crucial role in building a more sustainable future, addressing climate change, and fostering a healthier environment for generations to come."

    "**1. Making a Baseline Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "A good baseline model for predicting CO2 emissions should be relatively simple, easy to implement, and provide a reference point to compare the performance of more complex models. Baseline models typically serve as a starting point before exploring more sophisticated approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "For predicting CO2 emissions, a straightforward baseline model could be a simple linear regression model. Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable (CO2 emissions). The model tries to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the squared error between the predicted and actual CO2 emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Choosing our appropriate Evaluation Metric**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of predicting CO2 emissions using continuous values (a regression task), precision and recall are not directly applicable. Instead, we should consider evaluation metrics that are suitable for regression tasks, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Absolute Error (MAE) measures the average absolute difference between the predicted values and the actual values. It provides a simple and straightforward indication of how well the model is performing in terms of the absolute magnitude of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is similar to MAE but penalizes larger errors more heavily. It takes the square root of the average of the squared differences between the predicted values and the actual values. RMSE is often preferred when larger errors have more significant consequences, as it amplifies the effect of outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are interested in accurately predicting the CO2 emissions in continuous values, we should use MAE or RMSE as the evaluation metrics to assess the performance of our regression model. These metrics will help us gauge the accuracy and precision of the model's predictions relative to the actual CO2 emissions data."
