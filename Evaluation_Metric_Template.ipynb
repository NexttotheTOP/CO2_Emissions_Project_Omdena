    "# Template to choose our appropriate Evaluation Metric \n",
    "\n",
    "**Choosing a appropriate evaluation metric for our project is crucial as it directly impacts the assessment of our model's performance and effectiveness. Below there is a small template with some cases/points that we need to take into account and perhaps this could also help us to actually choose our right evaluation metric(s).** \n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand our Problem and Objectives:\n",
    "  \n",
    "To effectively tackle the problem of predicting CO2 emissions and their impact on the environment, we need a clear understanding of our project's objectives. Our primary goal is to identify the features that have the most significant impact on CO2 emissions, including human-related activities and natural occurrences like forest fires and volcanic eruptions. However, we should focus on features where we have the potential to make changes or interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideal approach is to build a Forecasting/Sequence to Sequence architecture model that accurately predicts the CO2 accumulation from human-related activities, natural activities, and their combined effects in the future. By comparing these predictions, we can determine the percentage of CO2 emissions that we can influence through our actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, we must leverage AI to uncover hidden correlations and patterns among the various features affecting CO2 emissions. The model should predict the outcomes of potential interventions, such as closing industries, to assess their impact accurately without needing to implement them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the nature of our objectives and the need for continuous predictions, our project should utilize a regression model for CO2 emission forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consider the Business Impact:\n",
    "  \n",
    "By correctly preciting the amount of CO2 emission that will be generated by specific actions/activities, undustries, companies, ... could take this into account before they start (some of) their operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "We must also think about which emissions of CO2 are most important to us, which aspects of CO2 emissions are most critical for our application, such as total emissions, sector-specific emissions, or emissions at specific time intervals. On which of these do we want to focus or selves? \n",
    "\n",
    "- Balance Between Precision and Recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "Only needed for classification tasks, this is not our main goal but there may be tasks, where we need to classify features in groups for example. This may be handy for small changes in our project for different goal settings (by our selves of other teams in the future)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluate Performance Against Baseline:\n",
    "  \n",
    "Before choosing a metric, establish a baseline model that represents the expected performance with minimal complexity or a naive approach. Compare your model's performance against this baseline to ensure your efforts have a meaningful impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Domain Knowledge and Context:\n",
    "  \n",
    "Take into account any domain-specific requirements or constraints. For example, in fraud detection, the cost of false positives (flagging a non-fraudulent transaction as fraudulent) might be different from false negatives (missing a fraudulent transaction). Domain experts can provide valuable insights in such cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Account for Imbalanced Data:\n",
    "  \n",
    "If your dataset is imbalanced (i.e., one class is significantly more prevalent than the other), using accuracy alone may not be a suitable metric. Explore metrics like F1-score, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), or area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR) that handle imbalanced data better.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Project Specific Metrics:\n",
    "  \n",
    "For specific applications or tasks, specialized evaluation metrics may be required. For example, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are commonly used for regression tasks, while Mean Average Precision (mAP) is relevant in object detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cross-Validation:\n",
    "  \n",
    "During model evaluation, perform cross-validation to obtain more robust estimates of model performance. This helps ensure that your chosen metric is consistent across different data splits and reduces overfitting."
